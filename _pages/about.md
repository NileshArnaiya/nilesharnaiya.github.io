No ChatGPTs were harmed while writing my life so far. It's 9th Jan 2024.

Thank you for visiting my bio. Welcome to my world. I'm Nilesh Jain/Arnaiya.

I learned to code pretty late when I was 17 years old, compared to the kids I taught being age 7 and up. Immediately the passion to learn was fueled, and I put in all the hard work – pulled all-nighters, learned from edX, Udacity, Coursera before it was cool – they were literally just launched then.

Was fully lost after failing my 12th grade due to carelessness and made another mistake doing a diploma, but we learn.

Did 5 internships in undergrad at Jain University in Bangalore, which was accidental as Dad just casually slipped in Bangalore in a conversation, and I searched and applied… just casually, and then I went. Scared shitless to take my first flight, and then it dawned on me that I had to stay alone with so many people. Made me strong going away for long for the first time.

School again didn't teach much, all was self-taught, but the exposure of Bangalore was great – attending the meetups there, got used to getting stickers, pens, and free lunch (Pizzas!) and sometimes t-shirts. My family still tells me this guy never buys t-shirts. Now I don't even buy socks :P

After all the exposure, internships (2 unpaid and 3 less paid) were in Android app development – those were the rage before AI tools came in. Did a bit of ReactJS and web dev here and there. Transformers didn't exist, idk why I do this to make myself feel old.

Did my first proper job (3 months :P) at Webloom solutions, but I couldn't handle it, so it was a mutual quit. Got fired from the next job at Genuin (Ahmedabad Story) coz I wasn't good enough. Next job, I was bored and quit in 2.5 months and waited for 4 months to get a South African visa to do my Master's there.

I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer with a SA-based startup (Casabio.org), but soon will be working with Midjourney, HuggingFace, or Instadeep. Manifesting you know. I'm in the process of making my own business identity as my fuel for jobs is as less fueled as the New Batman movie. PS: I come from a business(Baniya) family who are extremely religious(as per them) but don't follow it religiously. 

I'm a serial conference traveller and organizer for various conferences. 

I love doing my bit for underpriveleged kids whenever I can. 

I'm pretty bad in many things especially cooking and styling myself to go out. 

I change my accent pretty quickly according to where I am. 

I'm insanely weird but not a nerd. I read people. 

Story over.

## Things I Love (an exhaustive list!):

* Yoga, Books, Talking movies, AI Art, Astronomy
* Traveling (solo & with friends)
* Negotiating, Public speaking (Given talks at EuroPython, PyCon)
* Organizing (IndabaX and others)
* Volunteering (MAD, TFI)
* Gifting, Culture sharing, Tweeting, Teaching, Cycling
* Listening, Therapeeing, Business, Mentoring
* Brain & Body & Behaviour, Economics, Surfing, Cricket, Rafting, etc.

If you had seen me before 2021, I wouldn't have shared what I just shared. I was a private person, now laying all my life on a website for people to use against me. Now you get the idea.

If not, see other tabs and photos and read my writings and reach out to me on Twitter, Linkedin, Instagram, etc.

Thanks for reading, Ciao.
