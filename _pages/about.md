Site is still under development and going migration changes - Babloo AI. 
Thank you for visiting my bio. Welcome to my world. I'm Nilesh Jain/Arnaiya.  
I learnt to code pretty late when I was 17 years, compared to the kids I taught being age 7 and up.
Immediately put in all the hard work and passion was fueled, pulled all-nighters, learnt from edx, udacity, coursera before it was cool - they were literally just launched then. Was fully lost after failing my 12th grade due to carelessness and made another mistake doing a diploma but we learn. Did 5 internships in undergrad at Jain University in Bangalore which was accidental as Dad just casually slipped in Bangalore in a conversation and I searched and I applied.. just casually and then I went. Scared shit to take my first flight and then it dawned on me that I had to stay alone with so many people. Made me strong going away for long for the first time. School again didn't teach much, all was self-taught but exposure of Bangalore was great, attending the meetups there, got used to getting stickers, pens and free lunch(Pizzas) and sometimes tshirts. My family still tells me this guy never buys tshirts. Now I don't even buy socks :P 
After all the exposure, did 5 internships, 2 unpaid and 3 less paid in Android apps. Those were the rage before AI tools came in. Transformers didn't exist, Idk why I do this to make myself feel old. 
Did first proper job at Webloom solutions but I couldn't handle it so it was a mutual quit, 
Got fired from the next job at Genuin coz I wasn't good enough, next job I was bored and quit in 2.5 months and waited for 4 months to get a south african visa to do my masters there. 
I'm currently working as a Machine learning engineer with a SA based startup(Casabio.org) but soon will be working with Midjourney, HuggingFace or Instadeep. Manifesting you know. 
Story over. Now things I love. Exhaustive list. 
Yoga, Books, Talking movies, AI Art, Astronomy, Traveling(Solo & With friends), Negotiating, Public speaking(Given talks at EuroPython, PyCon), Organizing(IndabaX and others), Volunteering(MAD, TFI), Gifting, Culture sharing, Tweeting, Teaching, Cycling, Listening, Therapeeing, Business, Mentoring, Brain & Body & Behaviour, Economics, Surfing, Cricket, Rafting, etc. Now you get the idea. If not see other tabs and photos and read my writings and reach out to me on Twitter, Linkedin, Instagram, etc. 
Thanks for reading, Ciao.
