It’s 9th Jan 2024.</p> <p>Thank you for visiting my bio. Welcome to my world. I’m Nilesh Jain/Arnaiya.</p> <p>Are you lost?? Do you feel sometimes everyone is trying to get you? But nobody is. Do you feel like you do nothing with your life? Nothingness can be super awesome and not boring. Don’t you also like to experience the beauty of life, aging, travel in different phases of your living span? Don’y you wanna just hang out with strangers in a hostel and travel places, hike, hear jaw dropping stories and make a story of your life? NO YOLO POLO, don’t you want to spend money(exploit) 63% of the time and save only 37% of the time(Explore). Don;t you want to make a bucketlist, finish it and then make another? Or have you lost your curiosity with life? No right! Then why on earth we just live life like it shouldn’t be lived.</p> <p>Boring BIO Loading…</p> <p>I learned to code pretty late when I was 17 years old, compared to the kids I taught being age 7 and up. Immediately the passion to learn was fueled, and I put in all the hard work – pulled all-nighters, learned from edX, Udacity(They had an app - that old I am), Coursera before it was cool – they were literally just launched then.</p> <p>Was lost to my senses after failing my 12th grade due to an absence of mind(it was almost a taare zameen par scene) and made grave mistakes like doing a diploma, who does that, shit. but we learn.</p> <p>Did 5 internships in undergrad in Bangalore, which was accidental as Dad just casually slipped in Bangalore in a conversation, and I searched and applied… just casually, and then I went &amp; stayed there for 3 years. Scared shitless to take my first flight, and then it dawned on me that I had to stay alone with so many people. Made me strong going away for long for the first time.</p> <p>School again didn’t teach much, all was self-taught, but the exposure of Bangalore was great – attending the meetups there, got used to getting stickers, pens, books, bottles and free lunch (Pizzas!) and sometimes t-shirts(It was called swag only that time onwards). My family still tells me this guy never buys t-shirts. Now I don’t even buy socks :P</p> <p>I’m currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer and building Upcourse.io and codeuplab.com, I’m building a product on mentoring. In the process of making my own business identity as my fuel for jobs and clients is as less fueled as the New Star trek movie. PS: I come from a business family.</p> <p>Love making friends - any comma, in the previous three words and it’s a disaster.</p> <p>I’m a serial conference traveller and organizer for various conferences.</p> <p>I love doing my bit for underpriveleged kids whenever I can.</p> <p>Too many I’s they said, gonna use it all, bitches.</p> <p>I’m pretty bad in many things especially cooking and styling myself to go out.</p> <p>I change my accent pretty quickly according to where I am.</p> <p>I’m insanely weird but not a nerd. I read people and I listen.</p> <p>Story over.</p> <h2 id="things-i-love-an-exhaustive-list">Things I Love (an exhaustive list!):</h2> <ul> <li>Yoga, Books, Talking movies, AI Art, Astronomy</li> <li>Traveling (solo &amp; with friends)</li> <li>Negotiating, Public speaking (Given talks at EuroPython, PyCon)</li> <li>Organizing (IndabaX and others)</li> <li>Volunteering (MAD, TFI)</li> <li>Gifting, Culture sharing, Tweeting, Teaching, Cycling</li> <li>Listening, Therapeeing, Business, Mentoring</li> <li>Brain &amp; Body &amp; Behaviour, Economics, Surfing, Cricket, Rafting, etc.</li> </ul> <p>If you had seen me before 2021, I wouldn’t have shared what I just shared.
